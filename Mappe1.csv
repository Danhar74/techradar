Cypress;adopt;tools;TRUE;"<p>We keep receiving positive feedback on ""post-Selenium"" web UI testing tools such as <strong><a href=""http://www.cypress.io/"">Cypress</a></strong>, <a href=""/radar/tools/testcafe"">TestCafe</a> and <a href=""/radar/languages-and-frameworks/puppeteer"">Puppeteer</a>. Running end-to-end tests can present challenges, such as the long duration of the running process, the flakiness of some tests and the challenges of fixing failures in CI when running tests in headless mode. Our teams have had very good experiences with Cypress by solving common issues such as lack of performance and long wait time for responses and resources to load. Cypress has become the tool of choice for end-to-end testing within our teams.</p>"
Apollo;adopt;language-and-frameworks;TRUE;"<p>Our teams report that <strong><a href=""http://www.apollographql.com/client"">Apollo</a></strong> has become the library of choice when building a <a href=""/radar/languages-and-frameworks/react-js"">React</a> application that uses GraphQL to access data from a <a href=""/radar/techniques/bff-backend-for-frontends"">back-end</a> service. Although the Apollo project also provides a server framework and a GraphQL gateway, the Apollo client gets our attention because it simplifies the problem of binding UI components to data served by any GraphQL backend. Put simply, this means less code needs to be written than using REST backends and redux.</p>"
Contentful;adopt;platforms;TRUE;"<p>Headless content management systems (CMSes) are becoming a common component of digital platforms. <a href=""http://www.contentful.com/""><strong>Contentful</strong></a> is a modern headless CMS that our teams have successfully integrated into their development workflows. We particularly like its API-first approach and implementation of <a href=""http://www.contentful.com/r/knowledgebase/cms-as-code/"">CMS as code</a>. It supports powerful content modeling primitives as code and content model evolution scripts, which allow it to be treated like other data store schemas and enable <a href=""http://martinfowler.com/articles/evodb.html"">evolutionary database design</a> practices to be applied to CMS development. Its robustness and a stream of new features, including a sandbox environment, have impressed our teams further and made Contentful our default choice in this space.</p>"
Four key metrics;adopt;techniques;TRUE;"<p>The thorough <a href=""https://devops-research.com/research.html"">State of DevOps</a> reports have focused on data-driven and statistical analysis of high-performing organizations. The result of this multiyear research, published in <a href=""https://itrevolution.com/book/accelerate/"">Accelerate</a>, demonstrates a direct link between organizational performance and software delivery performance. The researchers have determined that only <strong>four key metrics</strong> differentiate between low, medium and high performers: lead time, deployment frequency, mean time to restore (MTTR) and change fail percentage. Indeed, we've found that these four key metrics are a simple and yet powerful tool to help leaders and teams focus on measuring and improving what matters. A good place to start is to instrument the build pipelines so you can capture the four key metrics and make the software delivery value stream visible. <a href=""https://www.gocd.org/"">GoCD pipelines,</a> for example, provide the ability to measure these four key metrics as a first-class citizen of the <a href=""https://www.gocd.org/analytics.html"">GoCD analytics</a>.</p>"
